# BalatroAncientJokerFix
## A Steamodded mod to fix the Ancient Joker in Balatro.

This mod updates the logic that selects the suit buffed by the Ancient Joker each round. It will work the same way The Idol joker does, where the suit selected is randomly picked weighted based on the cards in your deck. Ancient Joker will no longer buff a suit that you have no cards of in your deck!
