# AncientJokerFix
## A Steamodded mod to fix the Ancient Joker in Balatro

This mod updates the logic that selects the suit buffed by the Ancient Joker each round. It will work the same way The Idol, Castle, and Mail-In Rebate jokers do, where the random suit selection is weighted against your deck. Never again will Ancient Joker buff a suit that you have no cards of in your deck!
